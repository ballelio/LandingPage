            <p>Although all of our suppliers pledge not to use pesticides, herbicides or antibiotics of any kind, not all of our suppliers have pursued USDA organic certification because it is tremendously costly for small producers.  We have found that there are other, perhaps more important, indicators of quality and sustainability. </p>
